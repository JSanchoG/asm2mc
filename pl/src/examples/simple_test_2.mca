0020    CPA 10      ; Copy the value at address 0010 to the accumulator.
0021    SUB 11      ; Subtract the value at address 0011 from the
                    ; accumulator. Now there is an x-y value in the
                    ; accumulator.
0022    BRN 25      ; If the value in the accumulator is negative then
                    ; jump at address 0025. The value will be negative
                    ; when x is LESS than y.
0023    CPA 11      ; The jump did not occur, so min(x,y) = y.
                    ; Copy the value at address 0011 to the accumulator.
0024    BRA 26      ; Unconditional jump at the address 0026.
0025    CPA 10      ; The jump occurred, so min(x,y) = x.
                    ; Copy the value at address 0010 to the accumulator.
0026    STO 12      ; Write the contents of the accumulator, i.e. min(x,y)
                    ; at address 0012.
0027    HLT         ; Stop the processor.
